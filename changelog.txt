rev 109
New Quartus project created and old one deleted.
All leftover files from ECE385 removed.
Testbench set up to simulate CLOADM command.

Revision 110
New Quartus (version 10.0) project created and old one archived.
Optimized MULTIPLEXED_HEX_DRIVER.
Created MC6847_gen3 to replace MC6847_gen2.
	The MC6847_gen3 module provides the same functionality as the gen2 module with less resource usage.
Added synchronizers on PS/2 keyboard lines.
Main 50MHz clock is now derived from a PLL.
10MHz clock eliminated.
Created SDC file with constraints.
Set IO standard and current strength assignments.

Revision 111
Fixed bug in CPU core (Stack pointer should not be affected by reset).
Removed reset logic from MEM_128_8.
MEM_128_8 is now synchronous.
	After removing the reset logic and making the memory synchronous MEM_128_8 infers block ram.
Added ramstyle = "logic" synthesis attribute to MEM_128_8 (There are no free M9K blocks).
Replaced the MCM character ROM with one that more closely resembles the MC6847 ROM.
	The new ROM is smaller and uses one fewer M9K block.
Removed the ramstyle = "logic" attribute from MEM_128_8 (Using the last available M9K block).

Revision 112
Optimized MULTIPLEXED_HEX_DRIVER.
Optimized memory subsystem.
Simplified bus_arbiter_gen2.
Created SDRAM_controller and SDRAM assignments.
	A separate project will be created to debug the SDRAM controller.
Fixed SDRAM controller and replaced previous memory system.
